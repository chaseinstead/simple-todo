# Simple To Do
This is a simple To-Do-List, written in Flask. Its purpose is for me to understand Flask and a bit of SQLite.

# How to use this To-Do-List
It's yet to be deployed. Once that is done, it will be pretty intuitive. Add a task if you want or need to do something. Click done as soon as you are done with the task. 
You can view all your completed tasks in the archive. You can also clear your archive. All completed tasks will be gone then.

Enjoy!

# To Do for the To Do
- Build common (and good-looking) template for info pages ("added", "archived" etc.)
- Improve templates and css so everything is in sync
- Or even: build elements for completed actions that show up _on_ the page the user is at, instead of showing a separate page
- Make navigation bar look nice and flexible (improve view in narrow browser window)
- Add registration and login so each user can have their own list
- Add possiblity to export todo to PDF or something similar
- Build nicer layout that actually looks like a todo-list
- Deploy
