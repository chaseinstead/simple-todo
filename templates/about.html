    This is a simple To-Do-List, written in Flask. Its purpose is for me to understand Flask and a bit of SQLite.<p>
    <b>How to use this To-Do-List:</b> It's pretty intuitive. Add a task if you want or need to do something. Click <i>done</i> as soon as you are done with the task. You can view all your completed tasks in the archive. You can also clear your archive. All completed tasks will be gone then.<p>
    Enjoy!
